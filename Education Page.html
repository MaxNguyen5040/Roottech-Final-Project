<h3> School </h3>
<p> I attend Naperville North, a high school in a suburb of Chicago. I'm involved in a lot of clubs, and love the constructive learning environment. <br>

<h3> Clubs</h3>
<p> I'm involved with the clubs below:</p>
<ul>
<li> Science Olympiad</li>
<p> Science Olympiad (Scioly for short) is a science competition based club, where you choose a few events to research and get tested on. Last competition season, my 2 events were forensics and ornithology.Forensics, like in the movies, was all about identifying chemicals through testing. Super fun, but kind of a time crunch. Ornithology is the study of birds, which was a a research heavy event. I had a lot of fun doing the raw work to compile notes.</p>

<br><br>

<li> DECA</li>
<p> DECA is a business club, where you try to compete against others in different formats, like a multiple choice test, or a interview style conversation. I had a ton of fun studying and improving on my verbal skills.Also, I'm the Fundraising and Philanthropy Intern at my chapter. (Soon...) </p> <br>

<li> The Merry Tutor</li>
<p> The Merry Tutor is a student run tutoring organization! I think it's a great way to help and teach younger students.</p> <br>

<p> STAC is a student led committee that gives students the opportuinities to see how school technology works, and gives them a say in the matter. </p> <br>
